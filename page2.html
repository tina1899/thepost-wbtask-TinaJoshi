        <img src="images/dark1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>However many unique and distinguished leather options there may be, Suede Leather has always been an eye-catcher which attracts both men and women to its soft, velvety texture. It is mainly distinguished from smooth leather in the hide which is placed in the inner layer of the product, whereas in smooth leather it lies on the outsideof the skin. Manufacturerers use this leather to create products due the elegant, versatile, and ideal qualities it carries for both a formal or casual enviornment.    </p>

        <h3 class="feature-title">Correcting Leather </h3>
        <img src="images/dark2.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>What is Correcting? Correcting is the process Manufacturers generally use where you sand down the hides sternly and get rid of any blemishes by wiping it down with a clean and slightly damp cloth. Next they chemically treat the leather to correct any imperfections. This can typically done at home as well by using a leather conditioner to get the pigmented leather boots shine. Regardless, we can't forget that the whole charm of leather boots are the rugged looks it aquires over time, which is precisely why leather boots are such a worth while investement. They last you a lifetime.      </p>

        <h3 class="feature-title">Smooth Leather</h3>
        <img src="images/dark3.jpg" class="img-fluid">
        <p>Smooth Leather is potentially the most used leather by Manufacturers for creating the perfect ever-lasting leather boot. Contrary to what is seen in Suede Leather, the "visible" parts of these is the natural grain of the hide. The color aspects are most common in black, brown and tan. Additionally, to create the classic polished look, some Manufacturers may add a coated split leather in order to give the design a more fine look. Oppised to Suede leather which is one of a kind, Smooth Leather has a range of variety such as Full-Grain Leather, Top-Grain Leather, Genuine Leather, Pull-Up Leather and Side-Up Leather.   </p>
